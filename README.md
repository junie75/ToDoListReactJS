# React + Vite

ToDoList React Js is a self study project where I learned the basics of React JS, creating a project with vite, programming in JSX, seperating UI into components, how to utilize useState and useEffect hooks, saving data with local storage, spread syntax, and passing props. 

A big thanks to Web Dev Simplified who helped me with the creation of this project.
